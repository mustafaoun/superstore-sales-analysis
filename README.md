## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Discounts & Profitability:** High discounts negatively impact profits—optimization is crucial.
- **Category Performance:** Technology (especially *Copiers*) yields the highest profits, while Furniture (e.g., *Tables*, *Bookcases*) incurs losses.
- **Regional Trends:** West and East regions are the most profitable.
- **Customer Impact:** A small group of customers generates the majority of profits.
- **Seasonal Trends:** Year-end sales peaks suggest seasonal marketing opportunities.
- **Sales ≠ Profit:** High sales do not always translate into high profit—pricing/cost strategies should be reviewed.
